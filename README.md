🌦 Weather App - Task 05 Completed! ☁️

As part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech, I developed a Weather App that fetches real-time weather data using an API. This project enhanced my understanding of:

✅ APIs and Fetch Requests
✅ Handling User Input (searching for locations)
✅ Displaying Dynamic Data (weather conditions, temperature, etc.)

🛠 Tech Stack:
🌍 HTML - Structure of the web page
🎨 CSS - Styling for a user-friendly UI
⚡ JavaScript - Fetching and displaying weather data dynamically

🚀 This project strengthened my skills in API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch API & promises), and real-time data handling. Excited to work on more dynamic web applications!
